# Sensors Analysis
Our analysis of the sensors is available in the file `BeeHive_sensors_analysis.ipynb`. Although the analysis is based on structured data, the dataset contains missing values and is not entirely reliable. Additionally, we lack crucial contextual information, such as when the data reflected normal conditions or disasters. For instance, we do not know why the temperature dropped too low or spiked, or whether the low weight readings indicated bees dying, sensor errors, or some other issue. Therefore, while the analysis has been explained, it is important to note that the data is not sufficiently accurate.


# Image Processing
Our image processing is available in the file `Bee_Image_processing.ipynb`. More information and the analysis are added soon
